      goodtables is part of the Frictionless Data project from Open Knowledge International, which supports a wider discussion around open data quality. We believe that goodtables can reduce the processing time of your data publication workflow, whatever it may be. For us it answers one the most consistent questions we have encountered in our work with data over the last 10 years: How can one ensure, in a detailed and automated fashion, that data sources meet the quality requirements for further analysis and integration?
